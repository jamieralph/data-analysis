### A model for KPIs
This is a working draft.  
We've used a domain model approach to record concepts involved in measurement and KPIs

View the current model in the 'Measurement Modelling pdf
View the definitions in the Definitions Measurement csv file

#### Work so far
Several sessions with different roles in PDS to create a basic model  
Draft model and definitions documented

#### Next
Using real examples to record information and test the model  
Adapt model and definitions based on feedback
Create data source for KPIs and collect information more widely  
Identify other useful concepts that  
Can all or some information be made public?  
Is creating a .tll file useful?
